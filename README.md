# Supertype Fellowship
[Supertype Fellowship](https://fellowship.supertype.ai) is a development program for aspiring analytics developers, data scientists and software engineers looking to build a fulfilling career in these domains. The program features a combination of expert mentoring, peer-to-peer learning, and plenty of self-directed learning from a collection of curated learning resources.

Participants are expected to spend 10-15 hours per week on the program, and will be expected to complete a series of projects and assignments. The program is largely self-paced, and participants will be able to choose from a variety of learning paths in a buffet-style format. All members of this valued community will receive plenty of mentoring, from real professionals in the field, to help them acclimate to production-level data science and software engineering.

This is a program by [Supertype (Data Science Consultancy)](https://supertype.ai) and is run in adherence to our [Philosophy](https://supertype.ai/about-us/).
